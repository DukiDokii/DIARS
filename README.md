This is DIARS, the Dokii Interactive and Accessible Robot Service project by Duki.
This project was started on Sunday 5th of November 2023 and has not finished.
DIARS was made to be a virtual assistant similar to Siri or JARVIS from the Iron Man films.
DIARS listens for its name/keyword, 'Dokii'(pronounced d-o-key), then listens to your request.


DIARS is planned to be able to:
- Write notes
- Make reminders
- Tell the weather
- Tell the time
- Open an app
- Close an app
- Run py files
- Play music
- Stop music

And more may come.

Thank you for reading about DIARS and we hope you come back when we are done!
